# Simple-UDP-Listener

This repo is for simple communication between a unity scene and an aruino Transmitter. The Arduino will just broadcast information from sensors to the network. 
Intentionally it just spits out data constantly. It would be more elegant if the arduino code were modified to use interupt pins.
